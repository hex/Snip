# Session narrative (alex-geana-erepubliklabs-com)

## 2026-07-09 — Brainstorming "Snip": macOS radial snippet inserter

**Product:** macOS app. Store text snippets; hold middle-mouse (or a hotkey) → a
radial pie menu blooms under the cursor → drag toward a wedge → release inserts the
snippet's text at the cursor of whatever app is frontmost. Aesthetic north star:
**CleanShot X** (frosted vibrancy panels, rounded, SF Pro, restrained accent, spring motion).

**Decisions locked (with the "why"):**
- **Scope:** real, eventually-paid product distributed OUTSIDE the Mac App Store
  (core feature needs Accessibility + global CGEventTap + synthetic input, all
  App-Store-forbidden). Still build a working personal-grade v1 first; layer
  Developer-ID signing + notarization + Sparkle auto-update + licensing after.
- **Trigger:** hold middle-mouse = hero interaction, PLUS a configurable keyboard
  hotkey fallback (trackpads have no middle button → don't cap the market). Both
  converge on one selection path: drag + release to fire; release at center = cancel.
- **Core UX direction — "The Eight + escape hatch" (Strategy C):** resolves the
  central tension (muscle memory needs FIXED positions vs. capacity needs many).
  Ring positions are sacred; the long tail lives behind a deliberate door.
  - v1: **The Eight** — up to 8 hand-pinned fixed slots; empty slots ghosted (also
    covers the 0/1-snippet + onboarding cases). Cheapest credible build.
  - v1.5: **The Well** — dwell on center → ring exhales into a small frosted search
    palette for the long tail. Same gesture, no second hotkey.
  - v2: **Chameleon** — "your Eight, per app" (frontmost-app detection ~free; spend
    is onboarding). The paid-tier differentiator. Deterministic, not re-ranked.
- **Rejected:** re-ranking rings (Orbit frecency / Sixth Sense prediction) — they
  sabotage the muscle memory that justifies a radial over a searchable list.
  Wildcard parked: **Inkstroke** (blind marking-menu compound strokes) — future
  throwaway prototype, unmatched demo if the recognizer can be trusted.

**Process notes:**
- "using Fable" = user wants the claude-fable-5 model involved. Chose HYBRID: I (Opus)
  drive the interactive brainstorm; dispatch Fable subagents for divergent idea bursts.
  Fable generated the 12 radial concepts (agentId ad2813401fb8b8742).
- Visual mockup artifact (CleanShot-flavored, 3 strategies side by side):

**Still open (before spec):** snippet content model (plain text vs placeholders/
variables vs rich text); insertion mechanism (synthetic keystrokes vs paste-and-restore
vs Accessibility API); tech stack (native Swift/AppKit expected); persistence; mgmt UI.
